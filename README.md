    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    
   when interpreting user needs you must first look at your program and figure out how you can work to put them into your program in the first place.  User stories help in that regard by allowing developers to organize user needs and potential 
   features to add and prioritize them according to how important they are to put into the program if they will be put in at all they also allow developers to potentially see any bugs that might be in their program.
   
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    
    In this course we learned about the waterfall method which is inflexble and very schedule oriented as far as developing goes and if anything goes wrong its a major setback since other things cant get started until the thing thats being worked on is finished.
    Agile is the other methodology we learned about and its rather flexible and allows for the ability to pivot into something else should the product owner need that and fix problems that might occur during the development process and there's almost always going to be problems that rise up.
    Agile also involves more communication between parts of the team which allows everyone to be on the same page.
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    A good team member communicates with other team members so they know where they are as far as progress goes and makes sure to follow industry standard practices.
